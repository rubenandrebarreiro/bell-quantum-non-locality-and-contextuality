The three main stances towards realism are:
 1) Fight (Strong Realism):
    * "I believe in old-fashioned realism,
       and as such any putative ontology of
       this kind is cornered by the usual
       no-go theorems. Consequently, at least one of
       the assumptions of the considered no-go theorem,
       such as Bell - Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH)
       or Kochen-Specker (KS) needs to be dropped";

    * A possible Quantum Mechanics Interpretation that
      fits on the Fight stance is the De Broglie-Bohm
      Interpretation (Bohmian Interpretation), since:
      i)   Proposes a strong ontological realism,
           where the particles always have a well-defined
           position, momentum, and state, independently of
           being observed or not;
      ii)  Accepts local hidden variables that allow to
           explain the position, momentum, or state of
           a particle without requiring a notion of
           wave-function collapse;
      iii) Have a deterministic nature, where all
           the future quantum behaviour of a physical system
           is completely determined, given its initial state;
      iv)  (Try to) have causal explanations for all
           the quantum phenomena, using notions of
           quantum potential and pilot wave theory to
           explain quantum phenomena such as non-locality
           and wave interference, for example.

 2) Freeze (Medium Realism):
    * "I believe in a notion of 'modern realism',
       which is not captured by the ontological model
       framework and, as such, manages to sidestep
       the implications of the typical no-go theorems";

    * A possible Quantum Mechanics Interpretation that fits on
      the Freeze stance is the Copenhagen Interpretation, since:
      i)   Follows the idea of indeterminism, since it
           accepts the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
           as a fundamental and irreversible characteristic of
           quantum phenomena, where a particle can never
           have its position and momentum well-defined and
           determined simultaneously, for example;
      ii)  Has the observer playing a primary and central
           role, where the wave-function (probabilistically)
           represents our knowledge or information about
           the quantum properties of a physical system,
           avoiding and holding a deterministic explanation of
           quantum events and reality itself until the moment of
           an observation, focusing instead on the interaction
           between an observer and a physical system;
      iii) Accepts the notion of wave-function collapse as
           a fundamental postulate, during a quantum measurement,
           leading to a single outcome among the several ones
           described by the wave-function before that same
           quantum measurement happens, without seeking a deeper
           explanation for the underlying mechanism or process;
      iv)  Follows the notions of Bohr's Complementarity
           Principle, also interconnected with the Heisenberg's
           Uncertainty Principle, where the quantum properties of
           a particle and a wave cannot be computed and determined
           simulaneously by an observer actor, being complementary
           aspects of a physical system;
      v)   Settles on an instrumentalist approach,
           emphasizing the practical usefulness of theory
           for predicting experimental results rather than
           describing the underlying reality, avoiding
           deep philosophical aspects.

 3) Flight (No/Weak Realism):
    * "I do not believe in any notion of realism";

    * A possible Quantum Mechanics Interpretation that fits on
      the Flight stance is the Many World Interpretation, since:
      i)   Avoids the notion of wave-function collapse,
           postulating that every possible outcome or
           reality resulting from a quantum measurement on
           a physical system really occur, but in different
           and parallel branches of reality/universe;
      ii)  Accepts the idea of multiplicity of universes,
           where every quantum event results on dividing
           the universe into a large number of branches,
           avoiding explanations about the uniqueness of
           observed quantum events, rather than trying to
           reconcile the wave function with a single observed
           reality, allowing all possible realities to exist
           simultaneously in separate universes;
      iii) Avoids classical philosophical problems of
           quantum mechanics, such as the role of the observer
           and the nature of objective reality, circumventing
           the need for a special observer actor or
           a wave-function collapse mechanism;
      iv)  Reinterprets the traditional comprehension of
           the probabilistic and undeterministic nature of
           quantum measurements, redefining the respective
           probabilities as a distribution measure of
           many outcomes and realities;
      v)   Rejects the idea of classical realism,
           departing from the classical conception of
           a single reality objective and shared universe,
           while embraces the idea of multiple universes,
           in favor of a more complex and ramified reality,
           avoiding to reconcile quantum mechanics
           with a traditional view of reality;
