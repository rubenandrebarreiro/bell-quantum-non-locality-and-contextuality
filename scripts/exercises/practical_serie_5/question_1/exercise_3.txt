From the three main stances towards the notion of
realism that capture the usual way we deal with
the Bell - Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH)
and Kochen-Specker (KS) no-go theorems,
the one I find most appealing is:

 * Freeze (Medium Realism):
    => "I believe in a notion of 'modern realism',
        which is not captured by the ontological model
        framework and, as such, manages to sidestep
        the implications of the typical no-go theorems";

The justification is:

 * I strongly believe on the idea of intedeterminism and
   unpredictability derived from the probabilistic nature
   from Quantum Mechanics, as well as I also believe that
   the observer actor plays an essential role on the several
   interactions with the physical systems and their respective
   quantum phenomena. I also believe on the notions of both
   Bohr's Complementarity Principle and Heisenberg's Uncertainty
   Principles, where the quantum properties of a particle and
   a wave (e.g., the position and momentum of a particle) cannot
   be computed and determined simulaneously by an observer actor.
   Finally, I agree that most of these properties can be verified
   on a specialized laboratory with proper quantum devices,
   following an instrumentalist approach, from which we
   can validade the usefulness of theory for predicting
   some experimental results on practice, rather than
   deeply describing the underlying reality;

As a concrete interpretation ofthe two no-go theorems
(Bell - Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) and
Kochen-Specker (KS) no-go theorems) for my choice on
the stance towards the notion of realism I find most
appealing, is the following one:

 1) Bell - Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH):
    * Parameter Independence (PI) ∧ Outcome Independence (OI) ∧
      Measurement Independence (MI) ∧ Quantum Mechanics (QM)
      => Contradiction!

      => For this no-go theorem, I believe that both
         the parameters and outcomes of a physical experiment
         are not independent and can affect the final results of
         that same experiment, depending on the configured setup
         we choose a priori, dropping then both conditions of
         Parameter Independence (PI) and Outcome Independence (OI).
         However, I strongly belive that each observer actor
         plays an essential role in its interaction with
         a physical experiment, and have a free-will to
         choose the measurement configuration independently
         from all the others chosen by all the remaining
         involved observer actors, not dropping then
         the condition of Measurement Independence (MI);

 2) Kochen - Specker (KS):
    * Outcome Determinism (OD) ∧ 
      Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC) ∧
      Quantum Mechanics (QM) => Contradiction!

      => For this no-go theorem, I believe that
         the outcomes of a physical experiment can be
         undeterministic, depending on the configured
         setup of that physical experiment, the actions
         a possible observer actor make on that same
         physical system, the possible interactions that
         physical system can have with the environment,
         among many factors, affecting its outcome results,
         dropping then the condition of Outcome Determinism (OD).
         On the other hand, I believe that the measurements
         are usually defined and performed considering
         a global context for the physical experiment,
         depending on the configured setup we choose for that
         physical experiment, which can affect the values of
         the quantum properties being measured and their
         respective final outcome results, dropping then
         the condition of Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC).
