First, we need to address the following
conditions for the realism no-go theorems:

 1) Parameter Independence (PI):
    * The outcome result of a quantum measurement at
      one location does not depend on the parameter choice of
      quantum measurement (e.g., detector orientation) at
      a different distant location;

 2) Outcome Independence (OI):
    * The outcome result of a quantum measurement at
      one location does not depend on the outcome result of
      another quantum measurement performed at
      a different distant location;

 3) Measurement Independence (MI):
    * The configurations of a quantum measurement are
      independently chosen from the quantum properties of
      the particles that are being measured;

 4) Outcome Determinism (OD):
    * The quantum properties of the particles
      have well-defined values, independently of
      any quantum measurement performed;

 5) Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC):
    * The value assigned to any quantum property does
      not depend on the set of other quantum properties
      that are measured simultaneously;

The two no-go theorems addressed in this exercise are:

 1) Bell - Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH):
    * Parameter Independence (PI) ∧ Outcome Independence (OI) ∧
      Measurement Independence (MI) ∧ Quantum Mechanics (QM)
      => Contradiction!
    * This contradiction occurs because since
      Quantum Mechanics predicts quantum correlations
      that violate the Bell-CHSH Inequalities, then one of
      the respective conditions should be dropped or violated;

 2) Kochen - Specker (KS):
    * Outcome Determinism (OD) ∧ 
      Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC) ∧
      Quantum Mechanics (QM) => Contradiction!
    * This contradiction occurs because since
      Quantum Mechanics predicts that the outcome results
      from the quantum measurements depend of the context of
      the other quantum measurements performed, then one of
      the respective conditions should be dropped or violated;

Now we can analyse how the De Broglie-Bohm Interpretation,
Copenhagen Interpretation, and Many World Interpretation
deal with the previous Bell-CHSH and KS no-go theorems:

 1) For the Bell-CHSH no-go theorem:

    i)   De Broglie-Bohm Interpretation:
         * This interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
           is explicitly non-local, with the pilot wave
           theory or quantum potential used to determine
           the trajectory of a particle;

           a) Parameter Independence (PI) (Violated):
              * This interpretation is explicitally non-local,
                with the pilot wave theory or the quantum potential
                influencing the quantum properties of a particle
                non-locally, accepting the parameter dependency in
                the quantum measurements between distant locations;

           b) Outcome Independence (OI) (Violated):
              * This interpretation assumes non-local
                quantum correlations between the outcome results
                from the quantum measurements being performed
                between distant locations;

           c) Measurement Independence (MI) (Not Violated):
              * This interpretation assumes non-local
                quantum correlations between the outcome results
                from the quantum measurements being performed
                between distant locations;


    ii)  Copenhagen Interpretation:
         * This interpretation of Quantum Mechanics accepts
           quantum non-locality and indeterminism as fundamental
           characteristics, thus, considering Quantum Mechanics
           as intrinsically probabilistic;

           a) Parameter Independence (PI) (Violated):
              * This interpretation accepts implicitly
                quantum non-locality, where the outcome results
                from the quantum measurements can be affected
                instantaneously by the configuration of other
                quantum measurements being performed in
                another distant location;

           b) Outcome Independence (OI) (Violated):
              * This interpretation considers that all
                the outcome results of quantum measurements
                being performed in distant locations are correlated,
                thus, being consistent with the quantum predictions
                that violate the Bell Inequalities;

           c) Measurement Independence (MI) (Not Violated):
              * This interpretation assumes that all possible
                configurations of quantum measurements can be
                chosen independently of the quantum properties of
                the particles being considered;


    iii) Many World Interpretation:
         * This interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
           eliminates the needs for wave-function collapse
           and for violating Bell Inequalities, having
           quantum non-locality naturally built in;

           a) Parameter Independence (PI) (Not Violated):
              * This interpretation considers that all possible
                outcome results from a quantum measurement occur in
                different and separated branches of the universe or
                reality, but the chosen parameters on a location do not
                affect the outcome results in another distant location,
                within the same branch of the universe or reality;

           b) Outcome Independence (OI) (Violated):
              * This interpretation takes into account that
                the outcome results of quantum measurements
                performed on distant locations are correlated
                according to the predictions of Quantum Mechanics,
                within each specific branch of the universe or reality;

           c) Measurement Independence (MI) (Not Violated):
              * This interpretation assumes that all possible
                configurations of quantum measurements are independently
                performed on different branches of the universe or reality;



 2) For the KS no-go theorem:

    i)   De Broglie-Bohm Interpretation:
         * This interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it is
           a deterministic theory of local hidden variables
           and seeks to maintain a notion of classical realism;

           a) Outcome Determinism (OD) (Not Violated):
              * This interpretation maintains the determinism of
                the quantum events, since the trajectory of a particle
                is guided deterministically by the pilot wave theory or
                its respective quantum potential;

           b) Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC) (Violated):
              * This interpretation should accept the contextuality of
                the quantum measurements being performed to be consistent
                with Quantum Mechanics, meaning that a value assigned to
                some measured quantum property depends on the set of other
                quantum measurements being performed simultaneously;


    ii)  Copenhagen Interpretation:
         * This interpretation of Quantum Mechanics broadly
           accepts the context of the quantum measurements
           performed as a fundamental characteristic;

           a) Outcome Determinism (OD) (Violated):
              * This interpretation rejects the notion of classical
                determinism, accepting the intrinsically probabilistic
                nature of Quantum Mechanics, where the respective
                outcome results do not have pre-defined values
                before the quantum measurements occurring;

           b) Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC) (Violated):
              * This interpretation accepts that the outcome result of
                a quantum measurement depends on its respective context,
                i.e., it inherently depends on the set of all the other
                quantum measurements performed simultaneously;


    iii) Many World Interpretation:
         * This interpretation of Quantum Mechanics considers
           the context of the quantum measurements performed
           as a fundamental characteristic of the splitting of
           different and parallel branches of the universe or
           reality for a specific quantum event;

           a) Outcome Determinism (OD) (Not Violated):
              * This interpretation considers that a single
                outcome result of the set of possibel ones from
                a quantum measurement being performed is deterministic
                within each resulting individual and parallel
                branch of the universe or reality;

           b) Measurement Non-Contextuality (MNC) (Violated):
              * This interpretation takes into account that
                each quantum measurement being performed occurs
                in a specific context within the respective
                resulting branch of the universe or reality;


******************************************************************************


Conclusions:
 * From the two addressed no-go theorems, we can see the KS theorem
   as imposing more severe restrictions on classical ontologies,
   as it not only rules out local hidden variable theories,
   but also any theory that attempts to be non-contextual;
 * This notion means that any interpretation of Quantum Mechanics that
   seeks to maintain a classical and deterministic realism must accept
   the inherent contextuality of quantum measurements, which is
   a fundamental constraint that affects possible ontologies.
